# Billing & Credits

Kilo seats uses a transparent, two-part billing system: a monthly subscription per seat, plus pay-as-you-go model credits with zero markup.

:::note

Kilo Code seats purchases of Teams or Enterprise are separate from model provider credits.

No credits are included with a Teams or Enterprise purchase.

:::

## Organization Credits

Organization Owners can purchase credits on the [Organization dashboard](https://app.kilocode.ai).

Organization credits are purchased on behalf of all users in the organization. Every member of the organization can use credits in the organization's balance with the Kilo Code model provider.

Using organization credits works exactly like spending [individual credits](/basic-usage/adding-tokens), except that the credits come from the organization's credit balance, rather than the individuals.

### Buying Organization Credits

1. **Navigate to Organization tab** in dashboard
2. **Click "Buy More Credits"**
3. **Select credit amount** ($50, $100, $250, $500, $1000+)
4. **Complete payment** using saved payment method
5. **Credits available immediately** for team use

### Using Organization Credits

Organization members can use organization credits by choosing the correct organization profile in the dropdown in the Profiles tab of the Kilo Code extension.

## Managing Seats Subscriptions

In order to add Members to your Kilo Code Organization, you must have seat(s) available for them.

You can purchase more seats at any time during your billing cycle and will pay a pro-rated amount for the number of days left in your billing cycle.

You can remove empty seats at any time. Your next payment will reflect the smaller number of seats.

Your next billing date will not change.

To fill empty seats or remove members ahead of seat deletion, see the [team management](/seats/team-management) page.

### Adding Seats

1. **Go to Organization tab**
2. **Click "Add Seats"**
3. **Enter number of additional seats**
4. **Review pro-rated cost** for current billing cycle
5. **Confirm changes**

### Removing Seats

1. **Navigate to Organization tab**
2. **Click "Remove Seats"**
3. **Select seats to remove** (must remove team members first)
4. **Confirm reduction**

To fill empty seats or remove members ahead of seat deletion, see the [team management](/seats/team-management) page.
