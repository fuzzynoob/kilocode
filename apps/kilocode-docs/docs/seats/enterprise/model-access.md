# Model Access (Enterprise Only)

**Model Access** lets organization admins control which AI models and providers are available to team members.
Admins can **enable or disable** specific models, filter by attributes, and enforce organizational data policies.

## Managing Model Access

1. Navigate to the **Model Access** tab of the Enterprise Dashboard.
2. Toggle the checkbox beside any model or provider to enable or disable access.
3. Click "Save Changes" to apply

## Filtering Models

You can filter available models by:

| Filter                        | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Policy**               | Choose models that meet specific data retention or compliance requirements. |
| **Provider Location**         | Restrict models hosted in certain geographic regions.                       |
| **Series**                    | Filter by model family (e.g. GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5).                  |
| **Provider**                  | Limit access to specific providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.       |
| **Input / Output Modalities** | Filter by capabilities (text, code, image, audio, etc.).                    |
| **Pricing**                   | Compare cost per token or usage tier.                                       |

Select multiple filters for increased granularity.
